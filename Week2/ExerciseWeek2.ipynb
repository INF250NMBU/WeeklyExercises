    "This week's exercise involves experimenting with various image processing techniques using both Fiji/ImageJ and Python.\n",
    "You will compare the results of these techniques between the two environments.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "1. Import the original image (fountain.jpg).\n",
    "2. Apply a Gaussian filter with sigma=5 using scikit-image.\n",
    "3. Apply an Otsu threshold using scikit-image.\n",
    "4. Compare the results from Fiji/ImageJ and Python.\n"
